 
Corrections and Bug Fixes:

1) In map_display.c :
    void drawline(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, int draw_color)
    {
     /* The original code was flipping the x coordinates for evey line drawn.
	This was extremely confusing especially when using the mouse to
	select start and end points for a path. Fixed by saho (june 26, 1999).
     */
       window_drawline(window,x1,y1,x2,y2,draw_color);
       /*window_drawline(window,window->max_x-x1,y1,
	       window->max_x-x2,y2,draw_color);*/
    }

   It turns out that hte order of verices has to be specified in 
   counterclockwise direction. The source code says just the opposite
   but after the above correction this is no longer corect.


2) In main.c
   Commented out the questions about the kind of partitioning.

3) In main.c
     Reduced the values for the size parameters (safety and robot-radius).
