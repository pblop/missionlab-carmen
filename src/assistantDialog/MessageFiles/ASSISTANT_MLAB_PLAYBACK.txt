The replay window is similar to a standard media player. You can:

1) Replay the mission by clicking the triangular play button.

2) Pause or stop the replay at the point where the failure occured. 

3) Fastforward or rewind the mission to the point where the failure occured.

4) Use the slider bar to move through the mission playback.

3) Click on "Fix it!" button to start the repair process once you've identified the failure point.
