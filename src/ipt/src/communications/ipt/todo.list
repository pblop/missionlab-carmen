Message type:
   Add option of handling messages inside handler, i.e., make context useful

General:
   Add timers

Pigeon holes:
    When handling a pigeon hole, pass in the pigeon hole message itself rather
than a copy.

Interdomain messages:
    Query for translation and send with message name rather than wait for
    translation.

Messages:
    Add a "reset" field to messages.  When it is 1, FormattedData should be
recalculated.  This will be set by a ResetFormatted method (probably used, for
example, in a Destination's MakeMessage) and it will be invoked automatically
by a SetData call
    When recalculating FormattedData, use the structures that were allocated
rather than starting from scratch.

Desinations:
    Add a DisposeMessage method.  This will allow us to not delete a pigeon
hole message when it is handled, since the handler execution will do a
DisposeMessage rather than a delete

Server:
   Make server/client connections with Unix (or whatever) rather than just TCP
connections 
   Add message to that will disconnect a module (can be used to cleanly bring
down modules on VxWorks machines that have crashed without restarting the whole
system)
