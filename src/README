INSTALLATION
============

You can test this software easily in Fedora from version 11 to 17.
Fedora 15 is recommended because it has been our development environment.
Only 32 bits is supported. It won't work in 64 bits versions of Fedora.

Steps to install this software:

1.- Install rpm-build package (as root)
# yum install rpm-build

2.- Install dependencies (as root):
# yum-builddep missionlab_carmen-1.0.src.rpm

3.- Build your RPM package (as normal user):

4.- Install your RPM (as root):
$ yum --nogpgcheck install /home/USER/rpmbuild/RPMS/ARCH/missionlab_carmen-VERSION.RELEASE.ARCH.rpm 

Note that:
USER = your username
ARCH = usually i386 or i686
VERSION = 1.0-1 in this release
RELEASE = fcXX (Fedora release)
"--nogpgcheck" flag is needed because the RPM package is not digitally signed.

During installation, a full copy of the source code is placed 
at /usr/src to allow inplace building and code analysis.
