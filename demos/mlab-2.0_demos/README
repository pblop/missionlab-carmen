The following shell scripts set up the iptserver and run a
demonstration command script.

   demo1          --  Runs example3 (Typical military scout mission)
	          
   demo2          --  Runs robot-lab2  (Mobile robot mission in
                                        two rooms and a hall.)
	          
   demo3          --  Runs tech-demo4  (Based on one of our military
                                        technoogy demonstrations)
                      NOTE: When the robots get stuck at the
		            wall made up of obstacles (black
			    circles), the user needs to pop up
			    the teleoperation interface (under
			    the "Command" menu) and move the
			    team manually around the wall.
			    Press the [End Teleoperation]
			    button to continue automatically.
	          
   demo4          --  Runs democ (Mission similar to ARPA UGV Demo C)

   demo5          --  Runs robot-lab1 (simple mobile robot
                                       mission in one room.)

   demo_turn      --  Runs example_turn  (shows off formation turning)

   demo_formation --  Runs example_formation (shows off various formations)

Note that these scripts and the mlab and iptserver programs
generate quite a bit of output to the shell.  This is normal.

You can also run any of these command scripts by using the
"demo" shell script directly.  For instance, to run example3,
do:

   demo example3
